A search for Higgs boson decays to a pair of neutral scalars \Paa and \Pab with unequal masses is performed in final states with \PQb quarks and \PGt leptons. Depending on the masses of the neutral scalars, \Pab can undergo a cascade decay to a pair of \Paa scalars. For both the cascade and non-cascade scenario, one of the \Paa is always considered to decay to \PGt leptons, used for the online selection of events. A data sample of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138\fbinv recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC is analyzed. No statistically significant excess is observed over the standard model backgrounds. Upper limits are set on the Higgs boson branching fraction to $\Paa\Pab \to 2\PGt4\PQb$ and to $\Paa\Pab \to 2\PGt2\PQb$ along with the corresponding cross sections. The limits on the cross section $\sigma(\PH \to \Paa \Pab \to 2\PGt4\PQb / 2\PGt2\PQb)$ depend on the scalar masses and are observed to range between 0.8 and 37.8 pb. This analysis is sensitive to enhanced branching ratios of the neutral scalars into \PQb quarks and \PGt leptons for some of the non-cascade mass points.
