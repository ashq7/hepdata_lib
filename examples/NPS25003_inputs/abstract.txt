A search for Higgs boson decays to a pair of neutral scalars phi_1 and phi_2 with unequal masses is performed in final states with b quarks and tau leptons. Depending on the masses of the neutral scalars, phi_2 can undergo a cascade decay to a pair of phi_1 scalars. For both the cascade and non-cascade scenarios, one of the phi_1 particles is assumed to decay to tau leptons and is used for the online event selection. A data sample of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb^-1 recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC is analyzed. No statistically significant excess is observed over the standard model background expectation. Upper limits are set on the Higgs boson branching fraction to phi_1 phi_2 -> 2 tau 4 b and to phi_1 phi_2 -> 2 tau 2 b, as well as on the corresponding production cross sections. The limits on the cross section for H -> phi_1 phi_2 -> 2 tau 4 b or 2 tau 2 b depend on the scalar masses and range between 0.8 and 37.8 pb. This analysis is sensitive to enhanced branching fractions of the neutral scalars into b quarks and tau leptons for some non-cascade mass points.
